# Enhanced Feature Engineering for OULAD and UCI Datasets

This document describes the comprehensive feature engineering enhancements implemented to improve machine learning and deep learning results on both OULAD and UCI datasets.

## Overview

The enhanced feature engineering system provides:

1. **Dataset-Specific Feature Engineering**: Automatically detects dataset type (OULAD, UCI, or generic) and applies appropriate feature transformations
2. **Advanced Feature Interactions**: Creates polynomial features, interaction terms, and ratio features based on mutual information
3. **Statistical Aggregations**: Generates row-wise statistics, percentiles, and distribution characteristics
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies PCA and ICA for representation learning
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Creates transferable features for cross-domain learning
6. **Intelligent Feature Selection**: Uses mutual information and random forest importance for feature ranking

## Key Components

### 1. EnhancedFeatureEngineer Class

The main class that handles comprehensive feature engineering:

```python
from src.enhanced_feature_engineering import EnhancedFeatureEngineer

# Initialize for specific dataset type
engineer = EnhancedFeatureEngineer(dataset_type="oulad")  # or "uci", "auto"

# Apply feature engineering
X_enhanced = engineer.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_enhanced = engineer.transform(X_test)

# Get feature names and importance
feature_names = engineer.get_feature_names()
importance_df = engineer.get_feature_importance(X_enhanced, y_train)
```

### 2. Dataset-Specific Features

#### OULAD-Specific Features:
- **Engagement Intensity**: Normalized click patterns relative to standard deviation
- **Engagement Consistency**: Inverse coefficient of variation across temporal features
- **Performance Trends**: Polynomial fit slopes for assessment scores over time
- **Early vs Late Engagement Ratio**: Comparison of engagement in first vs last thirds

#### UCI-Specific Features:
- **Social Support Index**: Aggregated social and family relationship scores
- **Family Education Level**: Maximum and balance of parental education
- **Lifestyle Risk Score**: Aggregated health and alcohol consumption indicators

### 3. Domain Adaptive Features

For transfer learning between OULAD and UCI datasets:

```python
from src.enhanced_feature_engineering import create_domain_adaptive_features

source_enhanced, target_enhanced = create_domain_adaptive_features(
    source_X, target_X, source_y, target_y
)
```

## Feature Engineering Process

### Step 1: Core Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
- Encode categorical variables using label encoding
- Apply robust scaling for numerical stability

### Step 2: Dataset Detection
Automatic detection based on column names:
- **OULAD indicators**: `vle_total_clicks`, `assessment_mean_score`, etc.
- **UCI indicators**: `studytime`, `Dalc`, `Walc`, `famrel`, etc.

### Step 3: Advanced Feature Creation

#### Interaction Features
- Pairwise interactions between top 8 features (based on mutual information)
- Polynomial features (squared terms) for top 3 features
- Ratio features between feature pairs

#### Statistical Features
- Row-wise statistics: mean, std, max, min, median
- Percentiles: 25th, 75th, 90th
- Distribution characteristics: skewness, kurtosis

#### Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA**: Linear combinations for noise reduction
- **ICA**: Independent components for feature discovery

### Step 4: Feature Selection
- Mutual information-based ranking
- SelectKBest to retain most informative features
- Adaptive selection based on dataset size

## Integration Examples

### 1. OULAD Pipeline Integration

```python
from src.enhanced_oulad_integration import enhanced_oulad_feature_engineering

# Apply OULAD-specific enhancements
X_enhanced, feature_names = enhanced_oulad_feature_engineering(X_oulad, y_oulad)

# Use with existing OULAD deep learning models
from src.enhanced_oulad_integration import compare_feature_engineering_impact
results = compare_feature_engineering_impact(X_oulad, y_oulad)
```

### 2. Transfer Learning Integration

```python
from src.feature_engineering_integration import enhance_transfer_learning

# Apply domain-adaptive feature engineering
source_enhanced, target_enhanced, feature_names = enhance_transfer_learning(
    source_X, target_X, source_y, target_y, use_domain_adaptation=True
)
```

### 3. General Purpose Usage

```python
from src.feature_engineering_integration import compare_feature_engineering_approaches

# Compare different approaches
results = compare_feature_engineering_approaches(X, y)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = create_feature_engineering_report(X, y, output_path="feature_report.csv")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Feature Enhancement Ratios
- **OULAD datasets**: Typically 2-4x feature increase
- **UCI datasets**: Typically 1.5-3x feature increase
- **Generic datasets**: Typically 1.5-2.5x feature increase

### Computational Complexity
- **Training time**: O(n_features² × n_samples) for interaction features
- **Memory usage**: Scales with feature count and sample size
- **Feature selection**: Reduces final feature count by 10-30%

### Quality Improvements
The enhanced features typically provide:
- Better representation of temporal patterns (OULAD)
- Improved capture of social dynamics (UCI)
- More robust cross-domain transfer capabilities
- Enhanced model interpretability through feature importance

## Best Practices

### 1. Dataset Size Considerations
- **Small datasets** (<1000 samples): Use conservative feature engineering
- **Medium datasets** (1000-10000 samples): Full feature engineering with selection
- **Large datasets** (>10000 samples): Aggressive feature engineering acceptable

### 2. Feature Selection Strategy
- Always apply feature selection for >50 original features
- Use mutual information for classification tasks
- Consider cross-validation for feature selection validation

### 3. Domain Adaptation
- Use domain-adaptive features for transfer learning
- Align feature spaces before applying complex transformations
- Validate transferability with held-out target data

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Track feature importance changes over time
- Monitor for feature drift in production
- Validate enhanced features don't introduce overfitting

## Testing and Validation

The enhanced feature engineering system includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all feature engineering tests
